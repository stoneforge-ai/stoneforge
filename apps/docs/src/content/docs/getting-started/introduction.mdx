Stoneforge is an open-source multi-agent orchestration platform for AI coding agents. It coordinates multiple AI agents working in parallel on your codebase — each in its own isolated git worktree — and merges their work back together automatically.

## Why Stoneforge?

Modern AI coding assistants are powerful, but they work one task at a time. Stoneforge changes that by letting you break a project into independent tasks and dispatch them to multiple agents simultaneously.

- **Parallel execution** — Multiple agents work on different parts of your codebase at the same time
- **Git worktree isolation** — Each agent gets its own clean working copy, eliminating conflicts
- **Automatic merging** — Completed work is merged back to your main branch with conflict resolution
- **Event-sourced state** — Every action is recorded, making the system auditable and recoverable
- **Provider agnostic** — Use Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, or any compatible LLM provider

## How it works

1. You describe a high-level goal or set of tasks
2. The **Planner** agent breaks work into discrete elements with dependency tracking
3. The **Orchestrator** dispatches elements to available coding agents
4. Each agent works in an isolated git worktree
5. Completed elements are automatically synced and merged
6. You review the unified result
