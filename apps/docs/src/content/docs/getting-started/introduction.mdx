Stoneforge is a web dashboard and runtime for orchestrating AI coding agents. It coordinates multiple AI agents working in parallel on your codebase — each in its own isolated git worktree — and merges their work back together automatically.

## The problem

Running one AI coding agent is simple. Running several in parallel — a planner, coders, a reviewer — breaks down fast:

<div class="card-grid" data-sf-stagger>
  <FeatureCard title="Merge conflicts">
    Agents edit the same files on the same branch, creating conflicts that require manual resolution.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Wasted work">
    Two agents grab the same task, or one starts on work that's blocked by something else.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Lost context">
    When an agent fails mid-task, the next one starts from scratch with no knowledge of what was tried.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="No visibility">
    You can't see what's happening until you check each terminal individually.
  </FeatureCard>
</div>

## One platform

Stoneforge merges the entire software project management stack into a single agent-first system:

<div class="card-grid" data-sf-stagger>
  <FeatureCard title="Tasks">
    Issue tracking with priorities, dependencies, and scheduling — replacing Linear, GitHub Issues, and Jira.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Documents">
    Versioned document libraries with full-text and semantic search — replacing Notion and Obsidian.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Messages">
    Channel-based messaging with threading and inbox triage — replacing Slack and Discord.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Code & merges">
    Git worktree isolation with automated merge review and test gating — replacing manual branch and PR workflows.
  </FeatureCard>
</div>

Everything lives in one system and one interface, so agents (and you) never lose context switching between tools.

## Two layers

<Aside>
  Most users only interact with Smithy — it's what you install and run. Quarry works behind the scenes.
</Aside>

Stoneforge has two main layers:

- **Smithy** (`@stoneforge/smithy`) — the orchestrator. Spawns agents, dispatches tasks, manages sessions, handles worktree isolation and merge review. **This is what you install.**
- **Quarry** (`@stoneforge/quarry`) — the underlying data SDK. Event-sourced task management, sync, and storage. Used by Smithy internally; also available standalone for custom integrations.

## How it works

![The Director Panel opens as a sidebar where you describe goals and communicate with the Director agent.](/screenshots/director-panel.png)

1. You communicate your goal to the **Director** via the Director Panel in the web dashboard
2. Director creates a plan with tasks, priorities, and dependencies
3. **Dispatch daemon** detects ready (unblocked, unassigned) tasks and assigns them to idle workers
4. Workers spawn in isolated **git worktrees** (`agent/{worker-name}/{task-id}-{slug}`)
5. Worker executes, commits, pushes, then completes (creating a merge request) or hands off (returns task to queue with notes)
6. **Merge steward** runs tests, squash-merges on pass, creates a fix task on fail
7. Loop repeats for remaining tasks

## Agent roles

| Role | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Director** | Your strategic planner. You describe a goal, the Director breaks it into tasks with priorities and dependencies. Runs as a persistent session. |
| **Ephemeral Worker** | Spawned automatically by the dispatch daemon to complete a specific task. Executes in an isolated worktree, commits, pushes, then completes or hands off. |
| **Persistent Worker** | Started and stopped manually for one-off or exploratory work. Runs an interactive session and is not auto-dispatched. |
| **Steward** | Handles maintenance workflows — merge review, documentation scanning, recovery of stuck tasks, custom workflows. Runs on triggers or schedules. |

The **dispatch daemon** is a background process (not an agent role) that watches for ready tasks and assigns them to idle workers. Start it with `sf daemon start`.

## The dashboard

The Stoneforge web dashboard gives you real-time visibility into everything happening across your agents:

![The Activity page shows active agents, live status badges, and an event feed of recent orchestration activity.](/screenshots/activity-page.png)

## What you get

<div class="card-grid" data-sf-stagger>
  <FeatureCard title="Messaging">
    Channels, threads, and inbox triage so agents share context and escalate blockers without losing messages.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Issue tracking">
    Priorities, dependencies, scheduling, kanban views, and plan grouping — all visible in the web dashboard.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Documentation">
    Versioned document libraries with full-text and semantic search, so agents always have up-to-date project context.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Workflows">
    Playbook templates that instantiate into resumable task sequences with durable state — if a step fails, the workflow resumes from there.
  </FeatureCard>
</div>

## How is it different?

|                          | Claude Code Agent Teams | Stoneforge |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **State** | Ephemeral — file-based task list, no persistence across sessions | Event-sourced — SQLite + JSONL, survives restarts, full audit trail |
| **UI** | Terminal-only (tmux split panes or inline) | Web dashboard with real-time agent output, kanban boards, metrics |
| **Branch isolation** | Manual — "avoid editing the same file" | Automatic — each worker gets its own git worktree |
| **Task dispatch** | Lead assigns or teammates self-claim | Dispatch daemon auto-assigns by priority, respects dependencies |
| **Merge** | Manual | Merge steward runs tests, squash-merges on pass, creates fix task on fail |
| **Communication** | Lead-mediated messages, broadcast | Persistent channels with threading, inbox triage, searchable history |
| **Knowledge base** | CLAUDE.md only | Versioned document libraries with FTS5 + semantic search |
| **Structured processes** | Ad-hoc task lists | Playbook templates with resumable workflows and durable state |
| **Provider lock-in** | Claude Code only | Claude Code, OpenCode, or OpenAI Codex |
| **Scaling** | Single plan — limited by one account's rate limits | Multi-plan — split agents across multiple plans via custom executable paths |
