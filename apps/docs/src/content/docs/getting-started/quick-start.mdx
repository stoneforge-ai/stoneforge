This guide walks you through a complete multi-agent workflow — from creating a plan to watching agents execute in parallel.

## Your first orchestration

<Steps>
1. **Initialize your project**

   Navigate to a git repository and initialize Stoneforge:
   ```bash
   cd my-project
   sf init
   ```

2. **Create a plan**

   Describe what you want to build. Stoneforge's planner will break it into discrete elements:
   ```bash
   sf plan "Add user authentication with login, signup, and password reset"
   ```

3. **Review the plan**

   Open the Quarry UI to see the generated elements and their dependencies:
   ```bash
   sf quarry
   ```

4. **Start orchestration**

   Dispatch elements to agents and watch them work in parallel:
   ```bash
   sf run
   ```

5. **Review results**

   When all agents complete, review the merged changes:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -10
   ```
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  Use `sf status` at any time to see what agents are working on and how far along the orchestration is.
</Aside>

## What just happened?

Behind the scenes, Stoneforge:
1. Used an AI planner to decompose your request into independent work units (elements)
2. Analyzed dependencies between elements to determine execution order
3. Created isolated git worktrees for each agent
4. Dispatched elements to agents as their dependencies were satisfied
5. Merged completed work back to your branch
