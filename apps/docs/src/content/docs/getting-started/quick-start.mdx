This guide walks you through a complete multi-agent workflow — from installing Stoneforge to watching agents execute tasks in parallel.

<Aside type="caution">
  Before starting, make sure you have **Node.js 18+** (or Bun) and **Git 2.30+** installed. Your default agent provider (e.g. Claude Code) should already be set up and working.
</Aside>

## From zero to orchestrating

<Steps>
1. **Install the Stoneforge CLI**

   ```bash
   npm install -g @stoneforge/smithy
   ```

2. **Initialize a workspace in your project**

   ```bash
   cd your-project
   sf init
   ```

3. **Start the server and web dashboard**

   ```bash
   sf serve
   ```

   The dashboard opens at [http://localhost:3457](http://localhost:3457).

   ![The Activity page is the dashboard home — it shows active agents, status counts, and an event feed.](/screenshots/activity-page.png)

4. **Register a Director**

   ```bash
   sf agent register director --role director
   ```

5. **Start the Director**

   ```bash
   sf agent start <id>
   ```

   Use the ID printed by the previous command. You can also start the Director from the Director Panel in the dashboard's right sidebar.

6. **Register workers**

   ```bash
   sf agent register e-worker-1 --role worker
   sf agent register e-worker-2 --role worker
   ```

7. **Register a Merge Steward**

   ```bash
   sf agent register m-steward-1 --role steward --focus merge
   ```

8. **Give the Director your goal**

   Open the **Director Panel** in the dashboard sidebar and describe what you want to build. The Director will break it into tasks with priorities and dependencies.

   ![The Director Panel opens as a sidebar where you communicate goals to the Director agent.](/screenshots/director-panel.png)

9. **Watch it work**

    - **Activity** page — live agent output from all running agents
    - **Tasks** page — task statuses, assignments, and progress
    - **Merge Requests** page — completed work waiting for or passing merge review

   ![The Tasks page shows all tasks with their status, priority, type, and assignee.](/screenshots/tasks-page.png)

   ![The Merge Requests page shows completed work awaiting or passing merge review.](/screenshots/merge-requests-page.png)
</Steps>

## What just happened?

Behind the scenes, Stoneforge executed a coordinated workflow:

1. The **Director** decomposed your goal into tasks with priorities and dependencies
2. The **dispatch daemon** detected ready (unblocked, unassigned) tasks and assigned them to idle workers
3. Each **worker** spawned in an isolated git worktree (`agent/{worker-name}/{task-id}-{slug}`)
4. Workers executed their tasks, committed, and pushed their branches
5. Completed tasks created **merge requests** for the merge steward
6. The **merge steward** ran tests, squash-merged passing branches, and created fix tasks for failures
7. The loop repeated until all tasks were closed

## Tips

<Aside type="tip">
  - Run `sf doctor` to check system health at any time
  - Run `sf agent list` to see registered agents and their statuses
  - Run `sf task list` to see all tasks and their current statuses
  - Run `sf daemon status` to check dispatch daemon status
